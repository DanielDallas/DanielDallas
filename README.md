I'm a **Software Engineer**, but that’s just the title. What I do is solve problems; sometimes with code, sometimes by asking the right questions, and occasionally by just being curious enough to figure things out.

Over the past years, I’ve discovered that the best solutions aren’t always the most complex ones. Simplicity wins. Collaboration wins. Focusing on what matters wins.

I specialise in JavaScript, Python, React.js, Node.js, Cloud Computing, and Big Data Analytics; but tools are just that: tools. The real value is understanding how to use them to build something that creates impact.

Outside of work, I believe in giving back; whether it’s sharing knowledge, mentoring, or just being a helpful voice in the room. Because what’s the point of success if it’s only yours?

If you’re into building things that make an impact, let’s talk.
